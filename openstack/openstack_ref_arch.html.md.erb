<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This guide presents a reference architecture for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) on OpenStack. This architecture is valid for most production-grade PCF deployments in a single project using three availability zones (AZs).

##<a id='base'></a> Base Reference Architecture ##

The following diagram provides an overview of a reference architecture deployment of PCF on OpenStack using three AZs.

### <a id="base_components"></a> Base Reference Architecture Components

The following table lists the components that are part of a base reference architecture deployment on OpenStack with three AZs.

<table class="nice">
<th><strong>Component</strong></th>
<th><strong>Reference Architecture Notes</strong></th>
<tr>
 <td><strong>Domains & DNS</strong></td>
 <td>CF Domain zones and routes in use by the reference architecture include:<br><br>
   <ul>
     <li>zones for *.apps and *.sys (required)</li>
     <li>a route for Ops Manager (required)</li>
     <li>a route for Doppler (required)</li>
     <li>a route for Loggregator (required)</li>
     <li>a route for ssh access to app containers (optional)</li>
     <li>a route for tcp access to tcp routers (optional)</li>
   </ul>
 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td><strong>Ops Manager</strong></td>
 <td>Deployed on the infrastructure network and accessible by FQDN or through an optional Jumpbox.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td><strong>BOSH Director</strong></td>
 <td>Deployed on the infrastructure network.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td><strong>Application Load Balancer</strong></td>
 <td>Required. Load balancer that handles incoming HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and SSL traffic and forwards them to the Gorouter(s). Load balancers are outside the scope of this document.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td><strong>SSH Load Balancer</strong></td>
 <td>Optional. Load balancer that provides SSH access to application containers for developers. Load balancers are outside the scope of this document.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td><strong>Gorouters</strong></td>
 <td>Accessed through the Application Load Balancer. Deployed on the ERT network, one per AZ.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td><strong>Diego Brains</strong></td>
 <td>This component is required. However, the SSH container access functionality is optional and enabled through the SSH Load Balancers. Deployed on the ERT network, one per AZ.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td><strong>TCP Routers</strong></td>
 <td>Optional feature for TCP routing. Deployed on the ERT network, one per AZ.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td><strong>CF Database</strong></td>
 <td>Reference architecture uses internal MySQL.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td><strong>Storage Buckets</strong></td>
 <td>Reference architecture uses customer provided blobstore. Buckets are needed for BOSH and Elastic Runtime.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td><strong>Service Tiles</strong></td>
 <td>Deployed on the services network.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><strong>Service Accounts</strong></td>
	<td>Two service accounts are recommended: one for OpenStack "paving," and the other for Ops Manager and BOSH. Consult the following list:<br><br>
		<ul>
		<li>Admin Account: Concourse will use this account to provision required OpenStack resources as well as a Keystone service account.</li>
		<li>Keystone Service Account: This service account will be automatically provisioned with restricted access only to resources needed by PCF.
		</ul>
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><strong>OpenStack Quota</strong></td>
	<td>The default compute quota on a new OpenStack subscription is typically not enough to host a multi-AZ deployment. The recommended quota for instances is 100. Your OpenStack network quotas may also need to be increased.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### <a id="openstack_components"></a> OpenStack Objects

The following table lists the network objects in this reference architecture.

<table class="nice">
  <th><strong>Network Object</strong></th>
  <th><strong>Notes</strong></th>
  <th><strong>Estimated Number</strong></th>
  <tr>
  <td><strong>Floating IP addresses</strong></td>
  <td>Two per deployment, one assigned to Ops Manager, the other to your Jumpbox. </td>
  <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><strong>Project</strong></td>
  <td>One per deployment. A PCF deployment exists within a single project and a single OpenStack region, but should distribute PCF jobs and instances across three OpenStack AZs to ensure a high degree of availability.</td>
  <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><strong>Networks</strong></td>
  <td>The reference architecture requires the following Tenant Networks:
   <ul>
     <li>1 x (/24) <strong>Infrastructure</strong> (Ops Manager, BOSH Director, Jumpbox).</li>
     <li>1 x (/20) <strong>ERT</strong> (Gorouters, Diego Cells, Cloud Controllers, etc.).</li>
     <li>1 x (/20) <strong>Services</strong> (RabbitMQ, MySQL, Spring Cloud Services, etc.)</li>
     <li>1 x (/24) <strong>On-demand services</strong> (Various.)</li>
   </ul>
   An Internet-facing network is also required:
   <ul>
   <li>1 x <strong>Public</strong> network.<br/>
   </ul>
   <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: In many cases, the public network is an "under the cloud" network that is shared across projects.</p>
   </td>
  <td>5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><strong>Routers</strong></td>
  <td>This reference architecture requires one router attached to all networks:
  	<ul>
  	<li><strong>VirtualRouter</strong>: This router table enables the ingress/egress routes from/to Internet to the project networks and provides sNAT services.</li>
  	</ul>
  </td>
  <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><strong>Security Groups</strong></td>
  <td>The reference architecture requires one Security Groups.  The following table describes the Security Group ingress rules:
  	<table>
  	<tr>
  		<th>Security Group</th>
  		<th>Port</th>
  		<th>From CIDR</th>
  		<th>Protocol</th>
  		<th>Description</th>
  	</tr>
  	<tr>
  		<td>OpsMgrSG</td>
  		<td>22</td>
  		<td>0.0.0.0/0</td>
  		<td>TCP</td>
  		<td>Ops Manager SSH access</td>
  	</tr>
  	<tr>
  		<td>OpsMgrSG</td>
  		<td>443</td>
  		<td>0.0.0.0/0</td>
  		<td>TCP</td>
  		<td>Ops Manager HTTP access</td>
  	</tr>
  	<tr>
  		<td>VmsSG</td>
  		<td>ALL</td>
  		<td>VPC_CIDR</td>
  		<td>ALL</td>
  		<td>Open up connections among BOSH-deployed VMs</td>
  	</tr>
  </table>
  Additional security groups may be needed which are specific to your chosen load balancing solution.
  </td>
  <td>5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><strong>Load Balancers</strong></td>
  <td>PCF on OpenStack requires a load balancer, which can be configured with multiple listeners to forward HTTP/HTTPS/TCP traffic. Two load balancers are recommended: one to forward the traffic to the Gorouters, <code>AppsLB</code>, the other to forward the traffic to the Diego Brain SSH proxy, <code>SSHLB</code>.
  	<br><br>
  	The following table describes the required listeners for each load balancer:
  	<table>
  		<tr>
  			<th>Name</th>
  			<th>Instance/Port</th>
  			<th>LB Port</th>
  			<th>Protocol</th>
  			<th>Description</th>
  		</tr>
  		<tr>
  			<td>AppsLB</td>
  			<td>gorouter/80</td>
  			<td>80</td>
  			<td>HTTP</td>
  			<td>Forward traffic to Gorouters
  		</tr>
  		<tr>
  			<td>AppsLB</td>
  			<td>gorouter/80</td>
  			<td>443</td>
  			<td>HTTPS</td>
  			<td>SSL termination and forward traffic to Gorouters</td>
  		</tr>
  		<tr>
  			<td>SSHLB</td>
  			<td>diego-brain/2222</td>
  			<td>2222</td>
  			<td>TCP</td>
  			<td>Forward traffic to Diego Brain for container SSH connections</td>
  		</tr>
  	</table>
  Each load balancer needs a check to validate the health of the back-end instances:
  <ul>
  	<li><code>AppsLB</code> checks the health on Gorouter port 80 with TCP</li>
  	<li><code>SSHLB</code> checks the health on Diego Brain port 2222 with TCP</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: In many cases, the load balancers are provided as an "under the cloud" service that is shared across projects.</p>

</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Jumpbox</strong></td>
<td>Optional. Provides a way of accessing different network components. For example, you can configure it with your own permissions and then set it up to access to Pivotal Network to download tiles. Using a Jumpbox is particularly useful in IaaSes where Ops Manager does not have a public IP address. In these cases, you can SSH into Ops Manager or any other component through the Jumpbox.
