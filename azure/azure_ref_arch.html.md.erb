This topic describes a reference architecture for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) on Azure. It builds on the common base
architectures described in [Platform Architecture and Planning Overview](../index.html).

For additional requirements and installation instructions for running PCF on Azure, see
[Installing PCF on Azure](../../customizing/azure.html).

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

Azure Virtual Data Center (VDC) uses a hub and spoke model for extending on-premises data centers. For more
information about VDC, see the [Azure Virtual Datacenter e-book](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/azure-virtual-datacenter/).

When installing PCF, you can use this model to place resources in resource groups. For example, a PCF installation contains:

* **Hub**:
  * A central IT resource group included in Azure VDC setup. This is where you define firewall, access control, and
security policies.

* **Spokes**:
  * A Network resource group for all network resources.
  * PAS/PKS resource groups for all PAS/PKS resources.

### <a id="overview"></a> Diagram

The diagram below illustrates the reference architecture for PAS on Azure using the hub and spoke
model described above:

The sections below provide guidance about the resources that you use for running PCF on Azure.

## <a id="networking"></a> Networking

The following sections provide guidance about networking resources.

### <a id="network-considerations"></a> General Requirements and Recommendations

The following are general requirements and recommendations related to networking when running PCF on Azure:

* You must enable Virtual Network peering between hub and spoke resource groups. For more information, see
[Virtual network peering](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview) in
the Microsoft Azure documentation.

* You must have separate subscriptions for each resource group. This includes:
  * The central network resource group. This is the hub.
  * Each workspace where workloads run. These are the spokes.

* Use ExpressRoutes for a dedicated connection from an on-premises datacenter to VDC. For more information, see the
[ExpressRoute documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/). As a back up for when ExpressRoutes
goes down, you can use Azure VPN Gateways, which pass encrypted data into VDC through the internet.

* Use a central firewall in the hub resource group and a network appliance to prevent data infiltration and
exfiltration.

* You can place network resources, such as DNS and NTP servers, either on-premises or on Azure Cloud.

### <a id="dns"></a> DNS

For your PCF domains, use a sub-zone of an Azure DNS zone.

Azure DNS supports DNS delegation, which allows sub-level domains to be hosted within Azure. For example, a company
domain of `example.com` has a PCF zone in Azure DNS of `pcf.example.com`.

Azure DNS does not support recursion. To properly configure Azure DNS:

1. Create an `NS` record with your registrar that points to the four name servers supplied by your Azure DNS Zone
configuration.

1. Create the required wildcard `A` records for the PCF app and system domains, as well as any
other records desired for your PCF deployments.

You do not need to make any configuration changes in PCF to support Azure DNS.

### <a id="lb-types"></a> Load Balancing

Use Standard Azure Load Balancers (ALBs). To allow internet ingress, you must create the ALBs with elastic IP addresses.

During installation, you configure ALBs for PAS Gorouters. For more information, see
[Create Load Balancers](/platform/ops-manager/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.', '-') %>/azure/deploy-manual.html#lb)
in _Deploying Ops Manager on Azure Manually_. When applicable, TCP routers and SSH Proxies also require load balancers.

The PAS system and app domains must resolve to your ALB and have either a private or a public
IP address assigned. You set these domains in the **Domains** pane of the PAS tile.

### <a id="networks"></a> Networks

PCF requires the networks defined in the base reference architectures for PAS and PKS. For more information, see the _Networks_ sections in
[Platform Architecture and Planning Overview](../index.html).

### <a id="pas-single-azure-resource"></a> PAS on a Single Resource Group

If shared network resources do not exist in an Azure subscription, you can use a single resource group to deploy
PCF and define network constructs.

## <a id="ha-considerations"></a> High Availability (HA)

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> As of PCF v2.5.3, PCF on Azure supports both availability zones (AZs) and Availability Sets.</p>

Use AZs instead of Availability Sets in all Azure regions where they are available. AZs solve the placement group
pinning issue associated with Availability Sets and allow greater control when defining high-availability
configuration when using multiple Azure services.

For additional guidance depending on your use case, see the table below:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th style="width: 30%">Foundation Type</th>
    <th>Guidance</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>New foundation</td>
    <td>If you do not have strict requirements, select AZ-enabled regions. Examples of strict requirements include
        existing ExpressRoute connections from non-AZ enabled regions to customer data centers and app-specific latency
        requirements.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Existing foundation in AZ-enabled region</td>
    <td>Migrate to a new PCF v2.5.3 or later foundation so that you can use AZs. These existing
        foundations, especially those using older families of VMs such as <code>DS_v2</code>, risk running out of
        capacity as they scale.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Existing foundation <strong>not</strong> in AZ-enabled region</td>
    <td>Evaluate your requirements to determine the cost/benefit of migrating to an AZ enabled region.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

For more information about availability modes in Azure, see the following:

* [Availability Zones](#AZ)

* [Availability Sets](#AS)

* [Manage the availability of Windows virtual machines in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-manage-availability)
in the Microsoft Azure documentation.

### <a id="AZ"></a> Availability Zones

AZs are an Azure primitive that supports HA within a region. They are physically separate data centers in the same
region, each with of separate power, cooling, and network.

The following diagram illustrates PAS deployed on Azure using AZs:

![This diagram illustrates PCF with PAS on Azure using AZs. For specific details about the components and communication represented in this diagram, see the base and Azure reference architectures.](../images/PAS_Azure_with_AZs.png)

[View a larger version of this diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pivotal-cf/docs-pcf-refarch/master/images/PAS_Azure_with_AZs.png).

AZs have the following advantages:

* VMs and other zonal services deployed to independent zones provide greater physical separation than Fault Domains and
avoid the placement group pinning issue associated with Availability Sets.

* Zonal services are effectively in separate Update Domains as updates are rolled out to one zone at a time.

* AZs are visible and configurable. Two zonal services placed in the same logical zone are also placed in the same
physical zone. This allows services of different types to take advantage of the highly available qualities that a zone
provides.

### <a id="AS"></a> Availability Sets

Availability Sets were the first Azure primitive to support high availability within a region.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Availability Sets are implemented at the hardware rack level, which
can cause issues when deploying PCF on Azure. For more information, see
<a href="#placement-group-pinning">Placement Group Pinning Issues</a> below.</p>

Availability Sets have the following properties:

* They are a logical concept that ensures multiple VMs in the same set are spread evenly across three Fault Domains and
either five or 20 Update Domains.

* When a hardware issue occurs, VMs on independent Fault Domains are guaranteed not to share power supply or networking
and therefore maintain availability of a subset of VMs in the set.

* When updates are rolled out to a Cluster, VMs in independent Update Domains are not updated at the same time,
ensuring downtime incurred by an update does not affect the availability of the set.

#### <a id="placement-group-pinning"></a> Placement Group Pinning Issues

In PCF on Azure in Availability Set HA mode, VMs for a particular job are pinned to a placement
group determined when the first VM in the Availability Set is provisioned. This is because BOSH places VMs for each job
within the same Availability Set.

Cluster-pinning causes:

* Issues migrating jobs from one family of VMs to another, backed by different hardware, such as `DS_v2` and `DS_v3`

* Issues scaling up if there is no capacity remaining in the placement group

## <a id="storage-considerations"></a> Storage

For storage, Pivotal recommends:

* For the storage account type, use the premium performance tier.

* Configure storage accounts for Zone Redundant Storage (ZRS) in AZ-enabled Regions.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> In non-AZ enabled regions, locally Redundant Storage (LRS) is sufficient.</p>

* Configure VMs to use managed disks instead of manually-managed VHDs on storage accounts. Managed disks are an Azure
feature that handles the correct distribution of VHDs over storage accounts to maintain high IOPS as well as high
availability for the VMs.

* Use five storage accounts. PCF on Azure requires five storage accounts: one for BOSH, one for
Ops Manager, and three for PAS. Each account comes with a set amount of disk space.
Azure storage accounts have an IOPs limit of about 20k per account, which generally corresponds to a BOSH job/VM limit
of 20 VMs each.

## <a id="sql-server"></a> SQL Server

The Internal MySQL database provided by PAS is sufficient for production use.


## <a id="blobstore-storage-accts"></a> Blobstore Storage Account

Use Azure Blob Storage as the external file storage option for PCF. This provides redundancy for
high-availability deployments of PCF and unlimited scaling. Azure Blob Storage provides
fully-redundant hot, cold, or archival storage in either local, regional, or global offerings.

Ops Manager requires a bucket for the BOSH blobstore.

PAS requires the following buckets:

* Buildpacks

* Droplets

* Packages

* Resources

These buckets require an associated role for read/write access.

## <a id="identity-management"></a> Identity Management

Use unique managed identities to deploy Ops Manager, BOSH Director, Microsoft Azure Service Broker, and any
other tiles that require independent credentials. Ensure that each managed identity is scoped to the least privilege
necessary to operate.

Azure uses managed identities to handle service authorization. For more information, see
[What is managed identities for Azure resources?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview)
in the Microsoft Azure documentation.
