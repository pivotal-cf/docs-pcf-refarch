## <a id="intro"></a>Introduction ##

A PCF reference architecture describes a proven approach for deploying Pivotal Cloud Foundry on a specific IaaS, such as AWS, Azure, GCP, and vSphere, that meet the following requirements:

* Secure
* Publicly-accessible
* Includes common PCF-managed services such as MySQL, RabbitMQ, and Spring Cloud Services
* Can host at least 100 app instances, or far more

These documents detail PCF reference architectures for different IaaSes, to help you determine the best configuration for your PCF deployment.
