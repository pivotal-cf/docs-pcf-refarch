title: Migrating PCF to a New Datastore in vSphere
owner: Customer0
---



This topic describes how to migrate your Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) installation to a new vSphere datastore.


## <a id="prereqs"></a> Prerequisites

Both the new and existing vSphere datastores must reside in the same datacenter.

To avoid service disruption, Pivotal recommends that you configure your overall PCF deployment for [high availability](../../concepts/high-availability.html). In addition, check for configurations necessary to achieve high availability in each of your installed product tiles.

If your environment has any single points of failure, service may be disrupted as a result of the migration.


## <a id="prep"></a> Before You Begin

This section describes the steps you should perform prior to the migration.

### <a id="backup"></a> Step 1: Back Up Your Environment

Ensure that your PCF environment is fully backed up.

For more information about how to backup PCF, see [Backing up Pivotal Cloud Foundry](../../customizing/backup-restore/index.html).

### <a a id="doc"></a> Step 2: Document Current Environment Settings

Document your current environment settings before proceeding with the datastore migration. Record which VMs are running and in which datastore they reside. If you experience any issues during or after the migration, you must have this information to restore your environment.

To obtain this information, perform the following steps:

1. Run the `bosh instances` command.
  * If you use BOSH CLI v2, run:
    <pre>
    bosh -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT instances --details > instances.txt
    </pre>
    Where `BOSH-ENVIRONMENT` is the alias you assigned to your BOSH Director.
  * If you use the original version of the BOSH CLI, run:
    <pre>
    $ bosh-old instances --details > instances.txt
    </pre>

1. Save the resulting file `instances.txt` to a safe location.

1. Note the datastore where each VM resides in vSphere.

### <a id="system_health"></a> Step 3: Check System Health

In Pivotal Application Service (PAS), check the **Status** tab and make sure there are no errors or reported issues.

### <a id="tile_heatlh"></a> Step 4: Check Installed Products Health

In each tile installed in your PCF deployment, check the **Status** tab and make sure there are no errors or reported issues.

### <a id="opsman_health"></a> Step 5: Check BOSH Director Status

1. Check that there are no pending changes and that the status of all tiles is green.

1. Make sure the last Installation Log does not contain any errors.

1. Before proceeding with the migration, click **Review Pending Changes** and **Apply Changes** to make sure there are no errors in the Installation Log.


## <a id="migrate_proc"></a> Procedure: Migrate PCF to a New Datastore

1. In BOSH Director, navigate to the **vCenter Config** page.

1. Update the **Ephemeral Datastore Names** and **Persistent Datastore Names** field to reflect the new datastore names, then click **Save**.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you use the Datastore Clustering feature in vSphere, provide only the individual names of the datastores in the cluster. Do not provide the name of the cluster that contains them.</p>

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes**.

1. Confirm that the BOSH Director VM has persistent disk on the new datastore.
   1. Navigate to **vCenter Resource Pools** and select the **Resource Pool** that contains your PCF deployment VMs and new datastore.
   1. Click the **Related Objects** and **Virtual Machines**.
   1. Locate the Ops Manager VM and verify that the VM has an expected value in the **Provisioned Space** column.

1. In BOSH Director, navigate to the **Director Config** page, and select the **Recreate all VMs** option.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes**.
